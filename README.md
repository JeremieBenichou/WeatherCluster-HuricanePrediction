# WeatherCluster-HuricanePrediction

In this project, I explore weather data around the globe.
First, I'm establishing clusters on the globe.
Then, I look for anomalies within the clusters.
Finaly, I integrate hurricane data for supervised learning.

This is a project based on NOAA data using googles's big querry.
